# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project is a program for a grocer. It allows employees to create a file of each product sold that day, along with the frequency it is bought. This program also allows the user to produce a histogram of products bought for the day.
    
# What did you do particularly well?
I believe what was done particularly well is how the program was created in a clear and concise layout that would be easy to maintain or update.

# Where could you enhance your code? 
Certain functions would be better used as class files.

# How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Doing so would further improve maintainability and decrease complexity found in the "main()" function.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? 
Reading the data file produced by the Python portion was difficult since it was difficult to tell if C++ was reading the file properly for the histogram.

# What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
This program adds to a list of personal projects which demonstrate how certain functions were created for specific processes. Some files may also be inheritate in future applications.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Working with files, and integrating more than one programming language to increase efficiency.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Most major processes are created with individual functions. The main() function holds the least amount of coding which will improve its ability to be updated. Any additional functions or files may simply be inserted between each process of the function calls performed in the main() function.
